<h2>Project Explaination : Contact App</h2>
<h3>The Contacts mobile app consists of the following components:</h3>
<h4>App: The main component that renders the search box, contact list, and modal popup.</h4>
<h4>TextInput: A component that provides a search box for the user to enter a search term.</h4>
<h4>FlatList: A component that renders the list of contacts in a scrollable list.</h4>
<h4>TouchableOpacity: A component that provides a touchable area for the user to click on a contact and view their details.</h4>
<h4>Modal: A component that displays the details of a selected contact in a popup window.</h4>
<h5>When the app is launched, it requests permission from the user to access their contacts. Once permission is granted, the app loads the contacts and displays them in a list. The user can then enter a search term in the search box to filter the contacts based on their name. When a contact is clicked on, the app displays their name and phone number in a modal popup.</h5>
